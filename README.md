Modgud is an MCP auth proxy. It runs local stdio MCP servers, one child process per MCP session, and serves them as Streamable HTTP MCP endpoints that a tunnel such as Cloudflare Tunnel can expose. Modgud is its own OAuth 2.1 authorization server, so chat clients such as Claude and ChatGPT can connect. It maps every caller to a Grant, which sets the target service, the expiry, the tool allow and deny selectors, and the identity that Modgud passes to the tool.

Status: shaped, not yet in build. Phase 1 proves the OAuth flow with real chat clients.
